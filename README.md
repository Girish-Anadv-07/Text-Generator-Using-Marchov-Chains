# Text-Generator-Using-Marchov-Chains

There are several natural language processing tasks centered around text generation, including speech-to-text, conversational systems, and text synthesis. Most of us are familiar with text generation technologies that are used in our daily lives, such as iMessage text completion, Google search, Google's Smart Compose on Gmail, and many more. 

In this project, I will use Markov Chains to implement a simple Text Generator that could generate text based on the previous sequence of words used in the given sentence. My dataset comprises of 40 simple questions such as “what is your name”, “where are you from”, “who is coming”, “how are you”, “are you sick,” etc.
